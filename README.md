# PythonProjects

    This repository contains many different applications developed in Python.

    It is used as learning purpose only. So, each project is developed in the meaning
    of learning new concepts, methods, tools usage and algorithms skills.
    
    Follow some project examples:

        - Machine Learning;

        - Artificial Intelligence;

        - Data Structures;

        - Algorithms problem-solving;

        - Diagram as code; and

        - Much more, soon enough!


    I hope you can enjoy it as much as I do.
    Feel free to also contribute with suggestions and tips.
