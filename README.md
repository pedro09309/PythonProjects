    It is used as learning purpose only. So, each project is developed in the meaning

    Follow below a couple of examples:
        - Machine Learning;
        - Artificial Intelligence;
        - Data Structures;
        - Algorithms problem-solving;
        - Diagram as code; and
        - Much more, soon enough!

    I hope you can enjoy it as much as I do.
